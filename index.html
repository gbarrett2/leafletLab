	<h1>What the Map Shows</h1>
		<p id="p1">This map portrays the average cost of rent of one bedroom apartments in the top 21 most expensive cities in the United States.  The circles change size to show the change in rent when using the slider bar.  Since the map circles start by representing the average rent in January 2016 and go back in time to February 2015, the decrease in size of the majority of circles suggests that rents have been increasing throughout the past year.  However, there were no drastic changes, the largest increase throughout the year was in Boston by $990.  The three most expensive cities; San Francisco, New York and Boston, remained the three most expensive cities throughout the year, while other cities changed order slightly.  </p>
<h1>Data Analysis</h1>
		<p id="p2">The reason for the increase in rent in cities has to do with supply and demand.  Today more and more young millennials that want to move to the city because of the opportunities available in cities that they might not get in the suburbs.  Cities not only offer jobs, but are also more convenient.  Many young millennials also do not want to have the burdens of buying a house, they believe it will economically make more sense to rent an apartment in a city.  Due to the influx of people moving into the city, there is a lack of space and in return more expensive rents.  This is shown in the data by having only 5 out of the 21 cities have any decrease in rent.  Both CNN and Wall Street Journal have articles about the increase in the price of rent in cities.  Another factor is that due to the lack of construction after the market crash, was that there is a shortage of housing when the economy recovered.</p>
